# GRC Datasets Repository

This is the centralized repository for datasets used by the [GRC (Global Research Collaboration) organization at IIT](https://grc.iit.edu/). This repository contains various scientific simulation datasets organized by the I/O framework and application used to generate them.

These datasets are valuable for:
- Benchmarking I/O system performance
- Testing data management frameworks
- Developing visualization tools
- Validating scientific computing workflows
- Teaching and research in computational science

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by I/O framework:

- **[Adios](#adios)** - Datasets generated using the ADIOS2 I/O framework

## Index

## Dataset Details

### Gray-Scott

**Location:** [`Adios/Gray-Scott/`](Adios/Gray-Scott/)

**Description:** The Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model is a classic system in computational science that simulates the interaction between two chemical species. The model produces complex spatial patterns including spots, stripes, and spiral waves, making it ideal for testing I/O systems and visualization tools.

**Datasets available:**
- **L64-noise-variations** - Multiple simulations on 64x64 grid with varying noise levels (0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16)
- **L48-noise-0.16** - Single simulation on 48x48 grid with high noise (0.16)

**Resources:**
- [Gray-Scott Model Information](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/amorphous/GrayScott/)

### InCompact3d

**Location:** [`Adios/InCompact3d/`](Adios/InCompact3d/)

**Description:** Xcompact3d is a Fortran-based framework of high-order finite-difference flow solvers dedicated to the study of turbulent flows using high fidelity modelling such as Direct and Large Eddy Simulations (DNS/LES). Xcompact3d combines the versatility of industrial codes with the accuracy of spectral codes by using the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) to simulate complex geometries, while retaining high order accuracy.
