# GRC Datasets Repository

This is the centralized repository for datasets used by the [GRC (Global Research Collaboration) organization at IIT](https://grc.iit.edu/). This repository contains various scientific simulation datasets organized by the simulation framework or application used to generate them.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- [Adios](#adios) - Datasets generated using ADIOS2 I/O framework

## Index

### Adios

Datasets in this section are generated by various scientific applications using the ADIOS2 (Adaptable I/O System) framework for high-performance I/O.

**Applications:**
- [Gray-Scott](#gray-scott)
- [InCompact3d](#incompact3d)
- [LAMMPS](#lammps)
- [WRF](#wrf)

## Dataset Details

### Gray-Scott

**Location:** [`Adios/Gray-Scott/`](Adios/Gray-Scott/)

Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion simulation datasets. This is a classic model used in computational science for testing I/O systems and visualization tools.

**Datasets available:**
- Dataset 1
- Dataset 2

### InCompact3d

**Location:** [`Adios/InCompact3d/`](Adios/InCompact3d/)

**Description:** Xcompact3d is a Fortran-based framework of high-order finite-difference flow solvers dedicated to the study of turbulent flows using high fidelity modelling such as Direct and Large Eddy Simulations (DNS/LES). Xcompact3d combines the versatility of industrial codes with the accuracy of spectral codes by using the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) to simulate complex geometries, while retaining high order accuracy.

**Resources:**
- Source code: [github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d](https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d/tree/master)
- Benchmark instructions: [GRC Coeus Adapter - InCompact3D](https://github.com/grc-iit/coeus-adapter/tree/master/test/jarvis/jarvis_coeus/jarvis_coeus/InCompact3D)

**Available simulations:**
- ABL (Atmospheric Boundary Layer)
- Pipe Flow
- Cavity Flow
