## These datasets were generated using the LAMMPS application.
Please refer this [link](https://www.lammps.org/#gsc.tab=0) for LAMMPS.

This [link](https://github.com/simongravelle/lammps-input-files?tab=readme-ov-file) is where the the dataset comee from.  

The [NIST website](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-standard-reference-simulation-website) is the best approach to understand these lammps benchmark.

LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulation code designed to
run efficiently on parallel computers.  It was developed at Sandia
National Laboratories, a US Department of Energy facility, with
funding from the DOE.  It is an open-source code, distributed freely
under the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL) version 2.
