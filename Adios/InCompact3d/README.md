This is the dataset for Incompact3D

Xcompact3d is a Fortran-based framework of high-order finite-difference flow solvers dedicated to the study of turbulent flows using high fidelity modelling such as Direct and Large Eddy Simulations (DNS/LES), for which the largest turbulent scales are simulated. Xcompact3d can combine the versatility of industrial codes with the accuracy of spectral codes by using the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) to simulate complex geometries, while retaining high order accuracy. Its user-friendliness, simplicity, versatility, accuracy, scalability, portability and efficiency makes it an attractive tool for the Computational Fluid Dynamics community.
