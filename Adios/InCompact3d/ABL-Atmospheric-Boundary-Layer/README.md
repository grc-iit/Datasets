# Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL)

This dataset contains simulation results for an Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) flow using the Incompact3D solver.

## About ABL

The atmospheric boundary layer is the lowest part of the atmosphere and its behavior is directly influenced by its contact with the Earth's surface. This simulation models turbulent flow characteristics in this critical region.

## Dataset Contents

- `data.bp5/` - ADIOS2 BP5 output files containing simulation results
- `adios2_config.xml` - ADIOS2 configuration file
- `input.i3d` - Incompact3D input parameters
