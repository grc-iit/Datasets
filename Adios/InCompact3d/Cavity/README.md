# Lid-Driven Cavity Flow

This dataset contains simulation results for a lid-driven cavity flow using the Incompact3D solver.

## About Cavity Flow

The lid-driven cavity is a classic benchmark problem in computational fluid dynamics. It consists of a square cavity with three stationary walls and one moving wall (the "lid"). This simple geometry produces complex flow patterns including primary and secondary vortices, making it an excellent test case for CFD solvers.
