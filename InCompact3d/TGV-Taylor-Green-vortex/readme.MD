## Taylor-Green Vortices
The Taylorâ€“Green Vortex (TGV) is a well-known benchmark in CFD, modelling the transition from an initially laminar state to a fully turbulent one. It is attractive as a test case due to its simple setup, with the possibility to use a combination of periodic and free-slip boundary conditions

 We generate the data by performing a Direct Numerical Simulation of the Taylor Green Vortex case with a Reynolds number equal to 1,600.

Reference data for Reynolds numbers ranging from 1,250 to 20,000 can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/2577239#.YsV6GozMI5k). The reference data for Re=1,600 and Re=5,000 are also available in the examples/Taylor-Green-Vortex directory.
